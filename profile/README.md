# Backbase Open Source

Welcome to Backbase Open Source organisation. Regardless if you are a customer, partner, or employee you can create and share with everyone in the Backbase Community via this organisation.

Some of the repositories you will find here are directly maintained by our Backbase teams, as they contain essential tools used as part of our developer experience. See [backbase.io/learning](https://backbase.io/learning/) to pick up a course on our best practices and [backbase.io/developers](https://backbase.io/developers/) to see the official developer documentation.

You'll also find community created 3rd party connectors and accelerators that can be used to speed up projects. All the code found in this space is not supported according to the official Backbase SLA, but by the community. For more info see our [github organisation contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Backbase/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
